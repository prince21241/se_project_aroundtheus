# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

"This project showcases various parts of the US along with their tourist attractions. I had the opportunity to develop a comprehensive website optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Although the project posed challenges, it was also a rewarding and entertaining experience for me. Through overcoming these challenges, I've gained valuable skills and can now confidently build responsive websites for all three platforms."
