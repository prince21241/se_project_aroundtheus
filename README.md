# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Introduction to JavaScript
- Adaptive Web Design
- TripleTen Sprint 5

**Intro to Javascript and Adaptive Web Design**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. JavaSript was used to duplicate the cards displayed instead of having multiple cards in the HTML. This is my first project using Javascript and I will continue to improve on it as my skills in the language advance.

**TripleTen Sprint 5**

This is the 5th Sprint in the coding bootcamp TripleTen. Working with them had been such a pleasure so far. The entire TripleTen team has been a huge help with any questions or problems I had with the project and I can't wait to continue to work with them to develop my skills as a Software Engineer.

## Update 1: Added Animation to the site

Added animation when you hover over profile buttons. Added heart throb to like buttons.

## Goals for Next Update

So far, the frontend of this page is nearly complete. Features I would like to add in the future are a way to change the profile picture, as well as fix a bug where if an image is too large it displays outside of the screen. This can be seen when you preview Yosemite Valley for example.
